## MultiGP Chapter Landing Page Generator

This project is intended to serve as a base template that other chapters can customize to suit their needs.

At this stage, the implementation remains chapter-specific to streamline and accelerate initial development.
The long-term objective is to build a page generator script capable of automatically producing fully configured chapter landing pages, making it simple for any organizer to deploy their own instance on GitHub Pages with minimal manual setup.

**Core Features:**

 * Dynamically retrieves the chapter’s upcoming events via the RaceSync public API.
 * Allows users to open event details directly on MultiGP.com in a new browser tab.
 * Randomly displays a full-size background image upon each page load.
 * Presents the chapter’s sanctioning bodies, social media links, and contact email for quick access.
