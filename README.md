## MultiGP Chapter Landing Page Page Generator

This is a work in progress, meant to be built as a template for other chapters to adapt to their own.
For now, it's not as generic as it should be, to make development easier. The plan is to create a page generator script, so it is easy for anyone to host their own chapter landing page on Github Pages.

**Basic features are there:**

  * Load the next upcoming events of the chapter, from RaceSync's using the public API
  * On click, open the event on MultiGP.com in a new window 
  * Display full-size images randomly on each page load
  * Display sanctioning bodies and social links and email contact
