## Official website for KwadsRUs Racing Club

This is a work in progress, meant to be built as a template for other chapters to adapt to their own. For now, it's not as generic as it should be, to make development easier.

At least the basic features are there:

  * Load the next upcoming events of the chapter, from RaceSync's using the public API
  * On click, open the event on MultiGP.com in a new window 
  * Display full-size images randomly on each page load
  * Display sanctioning bodies and social links and email contact
